Date:   Wed Jan 2 18:17:58 2019 +0100

    Windows: use lua-unicode as built with VS 2017
    
    These binaries were built by AppVeyor using VS 2017 (MSVC 19.16.27025.1)
    and replaces locally built binaries using VS 2015 (MSVC 19.0.24215.1).
    I believe that these are the same as both of them use VCRUNTIME140.dll
    and import the same symbols. Using a newer compiler should however
    remove any doubt of compatibility with VS 2017 and should address
    concerns from Anders and Graham.
    
    These files are actually the "msvc2017_*.zip" files from
    https://github.com/Lekensteyn/lua-unicode/releases/tag/5.2.4-release1

    win-setup.ps1: verify integrity of downloaded files
    
    If for whatever reason a download got corrupted, detect this and
    reattempt the download. This protects the developer against server
    compromises. Additionally, if an uploaded file was wrong and needs to be
    replaced, then this check ensures that the updated file is used.
    
    The -Force option is removed as there is no point in downloading the
    same file twice (well, except maybe for verifying that all checksums are
    correct, but that can be done with a new destination directory as well).

Date:   Fri Dec 28 12:49:33 2018 +0100

    Windows: fix handling of Unicode paths in Lua
    
    Lua internally uses ANSI C APIs (such as fopen). On many systems (macOS
    and Linux for example) these work fine with UTF-8. Windows however
    requires special Unicode APIs (such as _wfopen), so patch the Lua
    library to interpret paths are UTF-8 and call appropriate Unicode APIs.
    
    Changes compared to the previous LuaBinaries zip archive:
    
    - Patched with UTF-8 support for loadfile, os.execute, etc.
    - Built with VS 2015 (VCRUNTIME140.dll) instead of MinGW (MSVCRT.dll).
    - Includes PDB file for lua52.dll
    - Includes lua52.exe and luac52.exe with UTF-8 argv support (wmain).
    - Includes build scripts, source files and README.md.
    - Extra subdirectory named after the zip file.
    
    These zip files are taken from https://github.com/Lekensteyn/lua-unicode
    (the "prepared" source zips can be found here as well.)

    wsutil: fix crash due to corruption of the "small_buffers" array
    
    Gracefully handle repeated calls of ws_buffer_free on the same buffer to
    avoid strange crashes in other new users that allocate a "small" buffer.
    
    The first call to ws_buffer_free would store data pointer in the
    'small_buffers' array for reuse and set the pointer to NULL. Result:
    
        (gdb) p cfile.rec.options_buf
        $2 = {
          data = 0x0,
          allocated = 2048,     // Oops, not modified!
          start = 0,
          first_free = 0
        }
    
    All users of Buffer (including ws_buffer_free) however asssume that
    'allocated' reflects the actual size of 'data'. If this is not the case
    (if ws_buffer_free is called again), then a data pointer (NULL!) will be
    stored and the next ws_buffer_init request for a "small buffer" will
    result in unexpected behavior (including crashes).
    
    Fix the issue by clearing the 'allocated' field as well. Add assertions
    to catch such issues earlier rather than crashing at random users of
    these buffers (such as frame_tvbuff).

Date:   Thu Dec 27 09:01:44 2018 -0500

    DNS: Use microsecond resolution for request/response statistics.
    
    The stat tree API only supports 32-bit integers and if nanosecond resolution
    is used correctly it's easy to hit integer overflow issues on even a fairly
    small capture file trying to sum up response times.

    CMake: Don't bundle our libraries at compile time.
    
    Setting LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY to Wireshark.app/Contents/Frameworks
    for each of our libraries ends up installing a fully versioned .dylib
    along with soversion and unversioned symlinks, which is more than we
    want and which wastes disk space when osx-app.sh dsymifies our
    libraries.
    
    Leave LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY unset and depend on osx-app.sh to copy
    our libraries into place.

    Qt: Open our preference dialogs via "clicked" signals.
    
    In ModulePreferencesScrollArea we create QPushButtons that open modal
    UAT and file dialogs. Open them via the "clicked" signal instead of
    the "pressed" signal. "clicked" is a general activation signal that
    fires after the mouse button has been clicked+released or a keyboard
    event. "pressed" fires before "released" and can be problematic in
    some cases.

    Clean up exp_pdu_open() API.

    have been allocated.
    
    Make the comment argument a "const char *" to 1) allow passing string
    constants etc. and 2) to catch any attempts to free it in
    exp_pdu_open().
    
    Make the callers free it after exp_pdu_open() returns.
    
    (Alternatively, we could have exp_pdu_open() take the file name argument
    and generate the comment itself, so that all code paths generate the
    same comment.)

    Apply port preferences during dissector handoff registration
    
    Handling of preferences is often done in the dissector handoff
    registration. Therefore this function is often registered as
    callback while registering preference handling for the module.
    In this way the preferences are processed both when registering
    the dissector and when changes happen.
    
    Some dissectors opt to register a seperate callback function to
    be called when preferences change. Now these have to be called
    from the dissector handoff function explicitly, in order to have
    the preferences processed during dissector registration.
    
    This becomes explicitly apparent when the port registration comes
    into play. With the migration to using dissector registration on
    ports with preference this port (range) is often retrieved from
    the preferences to match against the ports in a packet to determine
    an incoming or outgoing packet of a server. In case the callback
    function is not called from the dissector registration this
    determination fails, until the preferences are applied/changed,
    causing the preference handling callback to be called.
    
    This change add the calling of the callback during dissector
    registration, fixing some dissector port registrations in the
    process.
