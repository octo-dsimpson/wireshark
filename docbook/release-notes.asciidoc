=== Major API Changes

* Lua: on Windows, file-related functions such as dofile now assume UTF-8 paths
  instead of the local code page. This is consistent with Linux and macOS and
  improves compatibility on non-English systems. (wsbuglink:15118[])

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

== Known Problems

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.
wsbuglink:1516[].

Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
wsbuglink:1814[].

Filtering tshark captures with read filters (`-R`) no longer works.
wsbuglink:2234[].

Application crash when changing real-time option.
wsbuglink:4035[].

Wireshark and TShark will display incorrect delta times in some cases.
wsbuglink:4985[].

Wireshark should let you work with multiple capture files. wsbuglink:10488[].
